Package buckets provides a simplified interface to a Bolt database.

A buckets DB is a Bolt database, but it allows you to easily create new bucket instances.  The database is represented by a single file on disk.  A bucket is a collection of unique keys that are associated with values.

The Bucket type has nifty convenience methods for operating on key/value pairs within it.  It streamlines simple transactions (a single put, get, or delete) and working with subsets of items within a bucket (via prefix and range scans).  It's not designed to handle more complex or batch transactions. For such cases, use the standard techniques offered by Bolt.

What is bolt?

"Bolt implements a low-level key/value store in pure Go. It supports
fully serializable transactions, ACID semantics, and lock-free MVCC with
multiple readers and a single writer. Bolt can be used for projects that
want a simple data store without the need to add large dependencies such as
Postgres or MySQL."
